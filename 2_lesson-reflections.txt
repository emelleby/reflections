What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git will set up the folder to keep track of it. I need it so I can use git later and make commits to the files in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Adding it to the staging area makes it kind of ready to go into "production". Value? I don't know.
